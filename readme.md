# Running Your Project with Parcel

Parcel is a web application bundler that you'll use for development. It should be automatically installed via the npm install command, as it's listed as a devDependency in package.json.

To start the development server and view your project in the browser, run:

```sh
npx parcel src/index.html
```
Parcel will start a local server, and you can open your browser to http://localhost:1234 (or the port specified by Parcel) to see your application.
